# DM_React

React JS front-end that is used with DM_Tasklist. This front-end receives a screen share stream from the backend system.

Features include:

1. Video stream from back-end system monitor and optional dockerized celery task queue with rabbitmq
2. Recording macros to be executed on the computer hosting the back-end system
3. Sniping images from the stream and using them as input for actions
4. Settings to adjust the playback to be randomized to avoid a detection algorithm

More features coming soon!
